# Hacking the Hackthon Submission :) - My community contributions 
 
  This document has the intent to summup my contributions to the community [OpenData Community](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3) till the date of 23/01/23. 
 
 - Started [FAQ](https://opendatacommunity.org/docs/faq/) and contributed with these questions:     
    - What is a Sybil Attack and why we should fight it   
    - WTF is Quadratic Funding?   
    - What is the price of forgery?   
    - Where can I find more Sybil fighting content?   
  
- Proposed and contributed to the [Data Builder Hackathon Notes and Tips](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Resources/wiki/Data-Builder-Hackathon-Notes-and-Tips):
   -  Historical Transactional Data - Covalent      
   -  Problems running Raphtory: Python version and Windows OS    

- Solved Issues 
    - [Check Pokt Endpoints](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Resources/issues/47) did some research / testing and reported back to the community
    - [Python script to get transactional data from Covalent](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Resources/issues/50) this issue resulted on the scrip available to the community on the 'Data Builder Hackathon Notes and Tips'    
  - Not registered as a Issue but I did research on Lens protocol and brought the information in our weekly meetings , from that and Evan’s effort we manage to get profiles for the ODC and community members. 


- [Reflection and Proposal about the community, node centralization and access](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Resources/wiki/Reflection-and-Proposal-about-the-community,-node-centralization-and-access) : wrote about a discussion we were having on our meeting about running nodes. I would like to bring some light on how accessible node hardware are outside rich countries, I pretend to carry this discussion as we are tending to run our node as a community 

- [Fatom voters historical transaction till 23-01-23](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Resources/pull/112) made this dataset available to hackathon participants, during the ongoing hackathon so participants could test their Legos . Also, it will be included on our "Data Dictionary" page. 

Besides that I’ve been an active discord member, been in all weekly meetings, spread the word about our community to my network through Linkedin as in [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7019709391100592129/) , in twitter spaces I’ve tried to interact and make questions that would help other hackathon participants, and retweet a lot of our content.
